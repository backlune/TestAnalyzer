# TestAnalyzer
A web application for vizualizing test results based on .trx files. This application is based on the 
work done by TestParser, see [github link].

## Usage




## Examples

.\TestParser.exe /of:test.json "F:\Development\TestAnalyzer\TestResultsExample\*.trx"

## Issues & Planning

- Store 10 last test runs with long term data (only summaries)
- Store detailed data of the last test run (Summaries and test results)
- Handle branches!
